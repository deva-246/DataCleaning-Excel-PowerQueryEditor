## Data cleaning

Data cleaning, data cleansing, or data scrubbing is the act of first identifying any issues or bad data, then systematically correcting these issues. If the data is unfixable, you will need to remove the bad elements to properly clean your data. 

Unclean data normally comes as a result of human error, scraping data, or combining data from multiple sources. Multichannel data is now the norm, so inconsistencies across different data sets are to be expected. 

You have to clean this bad data before you start analyzing it, especially if you will be running it through machine learning models. 

Why? Because it can offer misleading or incorrect insights. If you’re using these insights to navigate important business decisions then this could be potentially devastating.

It can also be costly. Research from Gartner has found that bad data costs businesses anywhere from $9.7 million to $14.2 million annually. 

At the least working with bad data is a massive waste of time. 

It’s useful here to think of the commonly used phrase: “garbage in, garbage out”. 

This is a great way to illustrate that if you use data that is bad or unclean, you are likely to get results that are also bad. If you put good data in, you’re likely to get good results. 

## Data cleaning Using Excel

Microsoft Excel forms part of the Microsoft Office suite of software products. It is a spreadsheet that not only enables data to be stored in a tabular form i.e. rows and columns, but it also features calculation functionalities, graphing tools, pivot tables, and so much more. Before you can do any analysis with a dataset, it should be correct, consistent, and complete.
